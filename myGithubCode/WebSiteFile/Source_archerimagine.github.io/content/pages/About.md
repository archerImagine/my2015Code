* [Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on git ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8) Google, 12 October 2007.

This was said by Linus, and Mostly it is correct, but as mentioned by Aristotle "**The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.**" So I am trying to write blogs about the problem which I face while doing some technical learning.

I am a Software developer by profession, and a photographer by passion. It is said:- "**Do not leave a lawyer idle, he will become a politician, and don't leave a software developer idle he will become a photographer.**"


I have been working on Embedded System with C as the programming language. Now after 10 years, I am planning to learn some new technologies and relearn some Computer Sc course which we not available at my time. Thanks to MOOCs, we can practically learn anything.

Here is my Wish list to learn.

* Python.
* Object Oriented and Design Patterns in Python.
* Algorithms and Data Structures in Python.
* Machine Learning.
* Machine Learning packages for Python.

If you want to join my journey feel free to contact me.
